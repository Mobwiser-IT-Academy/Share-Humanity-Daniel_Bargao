          <h2>Covid-19</h2>
          <img src="images/coronavirus.jpg" alt="coronavirus" class="coronavirus">
          <p>The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2). The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of
            International Concern on 30 January 2020, and recognised it as a pandemic on 11 March 2020. As of 26 April
            2020, more than 2.89 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 185 countries and territories,
            resulting in more than 203,000 deaths. More than 822,000 people have recovered.</p>

          <p>The virus is primarily spread between people during close contact, often via small droplets produced by
            coughing, sneezing, or talking. The droplets usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces rather than
            remaining in the air over long distances. People may also become infected by touching a contaminated surface
            and then touching their face. In experimental settings, the virus may survive on surfaces for up to 72
            hours. It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread may be
            possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.</p>
          <p>Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. Complications may include pneumonia and acute
            respiratory distress syndrome. The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days,
            but may range from two to fourteen days. There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment. Primary
            treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy.</p>
          <p>Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering one's mouth when coughing, maintaining
            distance from other people, and monitoring and self-isolation for people who suspect they are infected.
            Authorities worldwide have responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews and
            stay-at-home orders, workplace hazard controls, and facility closures. Many places have also worked to
            increase testing capacity and trace contacts of infected persons.</p>
            <p>The most afected areas are the USA with roughly almost 1 milion of cases wich 55.000 died and 110.000 recovered, in a distant second place is Spain with 225.000 cases, 23.000 deaths and 100.000 recovered. Italy is the third country most afected with 200.000 cases, 26.000 deaths and 60.000 recovered.</p>
            <p>So what are the numbers here in Portugal, you ask. Well we are the 18th country in terms of cases with around 23.000. We still didn't got to the thousand death, we have 900 deaths registered due to Covid. Witch is really good but there are countries like Russia with 80.000 cases and only 750 deaths. We also have around 1.300 recovered people.</p>

          <h2>Shortage of goods</h2>
          <img src="images/Shortage_of_goods.jpg" alt="Shortage_of_goods" class="shortage">
          <p>There are shortage of goods, of everything on this pandemic. With the world being on a quarantine only necessaries industries are being maintained for example, food produce. But the virus started on china, and due to the outbreak, multiple factories and production lines in China have come to a halt. Because of that all types of goods will miss, for example even Coca Cola has said there may soon be shortages of its sugar free drinks, with the supply of artificial sweeteners from China affected.</p>

          <p>But when I mean shortage of goods, I mean really necessary things. Due to the panic that the media created a lot of people went shopping and bought unnecessary things for them that could’ve been really helpful to other people. One of the most common and most important items that is missing everywhere are masks. Because every person wanted a mask to be protected, they are nowhere to be seen, when the mask doesn’t protect the person that is using it, only protects the others. If you have the virus, it prevents you from spreading it. Since the beginning of the outbreak Hospitals don’t have enough masks for all the patients, because of that a lot of the professionals working on those got infected as well.</p>

          <p>Just as you can see panic can create a way bigger issue that initial was, and with that we connect this issue with the next one that is mental health.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="Mental-Health-2">
          <h2>Mental Health</h2>
          <img src="images/mental_health.jpg" alt="mental_health" class="mental_health">
          <p>Mental health is overall one of the biggest issues of our society while we are not in quarantine, so as you can imagine when people are confined to stay inside, and they can’t do what they want, be with friends, etc… the stress will rise and their mental health will deteriorate.</p>

          <p>Some people with the quarantine can’t get enough money like they did while working, so some of them can’t sustain the same lifestyle that they had, others can’t even get money to eat properly. Those issues themselves are enough, but they also create stress, anxiety, depression and other feelings that can be even more problematic than the issue itself.</p>

          <p>One of the reasons is that those feelings can create real health problems, like some diseases, anorexia, a lot more. And some of those will be revealed or recognized only after the quarantine is finished and probably the connection with this pandemic will not be recognized.</p>

          <p>Another act that is caused by those thoughts of stress, anxiety, depression, etc… that will probably increase and is the cumulative point of those thoughts is suicide. Japan being one of the countries with the highest suicide rate probably will be really affected by this pandemic in this specific part of it.</p>

          <p>Near me, from what I can see people are stopping to care about the quarantine, and they are going to familiars houses and having lunch or dinner there, even if they elderly, and they are in the high risk group.</p>

        <li id="Pollution-2">
          <h2>Pollution</h2>
          <img src="images/pollution.jpg" alt="pollution" class="pollution">
          <p>Pollution is overall one of the biggest issues of our day and age while we are not in quarantine, due for the high demand of resources and production. But while we are quarantined and a lot of industries stopped, that high demand was basically almost brought to 0 compared to what it was, and with that out pollution also came down.</p>

          <p>From what scientist say and studied, the ozone layer is being repaired so quickly that stopped some changes that happened in previous years that were really worrying. For example the melting of Antarctica that was one of the biggest issues, due to the fact of rising the sea level witch could submerge some coastal cities, completely stopped.</p>

          <p>Not only from air pollution but also from hearing pollution and being stopped there are a lot of different animals that started to occupy what us humans are not using. There are a lot of report and videos that show animals wandering through the cities, also plants are growing to places they are not supposed to be in, at least for human standards.</p>

          <p>And with this we can see how the ecosystem works without our presence, and we can also see how much worse we are making it. This is basically a warning for our society to do something or our planet will be in danger.</p>
