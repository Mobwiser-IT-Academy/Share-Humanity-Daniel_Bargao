          <h2>Covid-19</h2>
          <img src="images/coronavirus.jpg" alt="coronavirus" class="coronavirus">
          <p>The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2). The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of
            International Concern on 30 January 2020, and recognised it as a pandemic on 11 March 2020. As of 26 April
            2020, more than 2.89 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 185 countries and territories,
            resulting in more than 203,000 deaths. More than 822,000 people have recovered.</p>

          <p>The virus is primarily spread between people during close contact, often via small droplets produced by
            coughing, sneezing, or talking. The droplets usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces rather than
            remaining in the air over long distances. People may also become infected by touching a contaminated surface
            and then touching their face. In experimental settings, the virus may survive on surfaces for up to 72
            hours. It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread may be
            possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.</p>
          <p>Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. Complications may include pneumonia and acute
            respiratory distress syndrome. The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days,
            but may range from two to fourteen days. There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment. Primary
            treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy</p>
          <p>Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering one's mouth when coughing, maintaining
            distance from other people, and monitoring and self-isolation for people who suspect they are infected.
            Authorities worldwide have responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews and
            stay-at-home orders, workplace hazard controls, and facility closures. Many places have also worked to
            increase testing capacity and trace contacts of infected persons.</p>
            <p>The most afected areas are the USA with roughly almost 1 milion of cases wich 55.000 died and 110.000 recovered, in a distant second place is Spain with 225.000 cases, 23.000 deaths and 100.000 recovered. Italy is the third country most afected with 200.000 cases, 26.000 deaths and 60.000 recovered.</p>
            <p>So what are the numbers here in Portugal, you ask. Well we are the 18th country in terms of cases with around 23.000. We still didnt got to the thousand death, we have 900 deaths registered due to covid. Witch is really good but there are countries like Russia with 80.000 cases and only 750 deaths. We also have around 1.300 recovered people.</p>

          <h2>Shortage of goods</h2>
          <img src="images/Shortage_of_goods.jpg" alt="Shortage_of_goods" class="shortage">
          <p>There are shortage of goods, of everything on this pandemic. With the world being on a quarentine only
            necessaries industries are being mantained for exemple, food produce. But the vírus started on china, and
            due to the outbreak, multiple factories and production lines in China have come to a halt. Because of that
            all types of goods will miss, for exemple even Coca Cola has said there may soon be shortages of its sugar
            free drinks, with the supply of artificial sweeteners from China affected.</p>
          <p>But when I mean shortage of goods, I mean really necessary things. Due to the panic that the media created
            a lot of people went shopping and bougth unecessary things for them that could’ve been really helpfull to
            other people. One of the most common and most important items that is missing everywhere are masks. Because
            every person wanted a mask to be protected, they are no where to be seen, when the mask doesnt proteck the
            person that is using it, only protects the others. If you have the vírus, it prevents you from spreading it.
            Since the begining of the outbreak Hospitals dont have enough maks for all the pacients, because of that a
            lot of the professionals working on those got infected aswell.</p>
          <p>Just as you can see panic can create a way bigger issue that inicial was, and with that we connect this
            issue with the next one that is mental health.</p>
